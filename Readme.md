# LuaSTG+English

**LuaSTG+English** is a **LuaSTG+** English *translation and documentation* project.

[LuaSTG+](https://github.com/9chu/LuaSTGPlus) is a C++ Danmaku video game engine developed and maintained by [9chu](https://github.com/9chu). It uses [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) as its scripting language.

Modifications to the engine itself will be kept to a bare minimum and will be limited to translations only. No features will be added or removed.

Currently, *documentation translations are still being worked on*. Tutorials, user guides and example scripts/games will be posted *eventually*.â„¢
